# UOK CS 5th Batch - GitHub Organization

Welcome to the **UOK CS 5th Batch** GitHub Organization!

We are a group of **Computer Science** students from the **University of Kelaniya**, currently in our **5th batch**. This organization exists to foster collaboration and share knowledge among the students. It's a space where we build, learn, and grow together through shared projects, ideas, and personal profiles.

## üå± Our Intentions

- **Collaboration**: Encourage students to work together on projects, share ideas, and solve problems.
- **Showcase**: Provide a platform for each student to showcase their skills, projects, and achievements.
- **Growth**: Build a strong community that helps each other grow in technical and professional aspects.

Through this organization, we aim to create a space for the 5th Batch to thrive and build a legacy for future students to follow.
